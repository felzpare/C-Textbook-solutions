Programming challenge: Pennies for pay
Write a program that calculates how much a person earns
in a month if the salary is one penny the first day, two pennies 
the second day, four pennies the third day, and so on with the
daily doubling each day the employee works. The program should ask the user
for the number of days the employee worked during the month,
validate that it is between 1 and 3`, and then display a table showing how much
the salary was for each day worked, as well as the total pay earned for the month.
The output should be displayed in dollars with two decimal points, not in pennies
*****/
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int count=1, days; //count is the incrementer, user inputted control variable
	double pay=0.01, total=0.00; //pay is the starting value and total is the accumulator
	
	//user inputted days worked
	cout << "Enter the number of days worked for the month" << endl;
	cin >> days;
	
	while (!(days>=1 && days<=31))
	{
		cout << "Enter the number of days worked for the month between 1 and 31";
		cin >> days;
	}
	
	while(count <=days)
	{
		
		cout << "Salary for day " << count << ": $" << pay << endl;
		count++;
		total+=pay;
		
		pay= pay*2;
		
		
	}
	
	
	cout << "The total monthly salary is: $" << fixed << setprecision(2) << total;
	
	
	
	return 0;
}

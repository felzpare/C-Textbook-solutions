Programming challenge: Markup
Write a program that asks the user to enter an item's wholesale cost and its markup
percentage. It should then display the item's retail price. For example:
  -If an item's wholesale cost is $5.00 and its markup percentage s 100 percent, then
  the item's retail price is $10.00.
  -If an item's wholesale cost is $5.00 and its markup percentage is 50 percent, then
  the item's retail price is $7.50.
The program should have a function named calculateRetail that receives the wholesale cost and the markup percentage
as arguments and returns the retail price of the item.

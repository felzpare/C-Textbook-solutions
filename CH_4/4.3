***Programming challenges: Magic Dates
*
The date June 10, 1960, is special because when we write it in the following format, the month
times the day equals the year
6/10/60
Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year. The program,
should then determine whether the month times the dat is equal to the year. If so, it should display a message saying
the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display a message saying the date is not magic.
Input validation: Think about what legal values the program should accept for month and day.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int month, day, year;
	
	cout << "Please enter a month between 1 and 12\n";
	cin >> month;
	
	if (month <= 0 || month >12)
	{
		cout << "\nThat is not a valid entry\n";
		return 0;
	}	
	
	
	cout << "\nPlease enter a day of the month between 1 and 31\n";
	cin >> day;
	
	if (day <= 0 || day>31)
	{
		cout << "\nThat is not a valid entry\n";
		return 0;
	}	
	
	
	cout << "\nPlease enter a two-digit year\n";
	cin >> year;
	
	if (year <=00 || year >99)
	{
		cout << "\nThat is not a valid entry\n";
		return 0;
	}	
		
	
	
	
	if (month*day==year)
	{
		cout << "\n" << month << "/" << day << "/" << year << "\n";
		cout << "\nThe date is magic!\n";
	}
	else
		cout << "\nThe date is not magic\n";
		
	return 0;
}

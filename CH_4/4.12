Programming challenge: Color Mixer
The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot
be made by mixing other colors. When you mix two primary colors, you het a secondary color
as shown here:
*When you mix red and blue, you get purple
*When you mix red and yellow, you get orange
*When you mix blue and yellow, you get green
Write a program that asks the user to enter the names of two primary colors to mix.
If the user enters anything other than "red", "blue", or "yellow", the program
should display an error message. Otherwise the program should display the name of the secondary color that results

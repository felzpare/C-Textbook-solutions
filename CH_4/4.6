***Programming challenge: Change for a dollar game
*
Create a change-counting game that asks the user to enter what coins to use to make exactly one dollar.
The program should ask the user to enter the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. If the total value of the coins
entered is equal to one dollar, the program should congratulate the user for winning the game.
Otherwise the program should display a message indicating whether the amount entered was more or less than one dollar.
Use constant variables to hold the coin values.

	int pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters;
	double totalvalue;
	
	const double PEN= 0.01,

				 DIME= 0.10,
				 QUART= 0.25;
				 
	
	cout << "Enter the number of pennies\n";
	cin >> pennies;
	if (pennies <0)
	{

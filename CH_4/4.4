***Programming challenges: Areas of rectangles
*
The area of a rectangle is the rectangle's length times its width. Write a program that asks for the length
and width of two rectangles. The program should then tell the user which rectangle
has the greater area or if the areas are the same.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	double rectangle1, rectangle2, length1, length2, width1, width2;
	
	cout << "Enter the length and width of a rectangle\n";
	cin >> length1 >> width1;
	if (length1 <0 || width1 <0)
	{
		cout << "That is not a valid entry";
		return 0;
	}

	
	cout << "Enter the length and width of a second rectangle\n";
	cin >> length2 >> width2;
	if (length2 <0 || width2 <0)
	{
		cout << "That is not a valid entry";
		return 0;
	}

	
	rectangle1=length1*width1;
	rectangle2=length2*width2;
	
	 
	if (rectangle1 < rectangle2)
		cout << "Rectangle 2 has a greater area than rectangle 1";
	else if (rectangle1 > rectangle2)
		cout << "Rectangle 1 has a greater area than rectangle 2";
	else
		cout << "Both rectangles have equal areas";
		

	return 0;
	
	
}

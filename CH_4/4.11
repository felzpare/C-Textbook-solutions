Programming challenges: Geometry calculator
Write a program that displays the following menu:
* Geometry Calculator
    1. Calculate the Area of a Circle 
    2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
    3. Calculate the Area of a Triangle
    4. Quit
Enter your choice (1 - 4):
*If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the 
*circle and then display its area. Use 3.14159 for pi.
*If the user enters 2, the program should ask for the length and
*width of the rectangle, then display the rectangle's area.
*If the user enters 3, the program should ask for the length of
*the triangle's base and its height, then display its area.
*If the user enters 4, the program should end.

 Programming challenge: Running the race
 Write a program that asks for the names of three runners and the time it took
 each of them to finish a race. The program should display who came in first, second,
 and third place. Think about how many test cases are needed to verify that your problem works correctly.
 (That is, how many different finish orders are possible?)
 Input Validation: Only allow the program to accept positive numbers for the times

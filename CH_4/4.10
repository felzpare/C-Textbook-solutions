Programming challenge: Bank Charges
A bank charges $15 per month plus the following fees for a commercial
checking account:
$0.10 each for fewer than 20 checks
$0.08 each for 20-39 checks
$0.06 each for 40-59 checks
$0.04 each for 60 or more checks
Write a program that asks for the number of checks written during the past month,
then computes and displays the bank's fees for the month
Input Validtion: decide how the program should gandle an input of less than 0.

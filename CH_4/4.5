***Programming challenge: Book Club Points
*
An Online Book club awards points to its customers based on the number of books
purchased each month. Points are awarded as follows: 0 Books=0 points,
1 book=5 points, 2 books=15 points, 3 books=30 points, 4 or more=50 points. Write a program
that asks the user to enter the number of books purchased this month then displays
the number of points awarded.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int PurchasedBooks, Points;
	
	//Input
	cout << "Please enter the number of books purchased\n";
	cin >> PurchasedBooks;
	
	//Process
	if (PurchasedBooks == 0)
		Points = 0;
	else if (PurchasedBooks == 1)
		Points = 5;
	else if (PurchasedBooks == 2)
		Points = 15;
	else if (PurchasedBooks == 3)
		Points = 30;
	else if (PurchasedBooks >= 4)
		Points = 50;
		
	//Output
	cout << "The number of points awarded is " << Points << endl;
